# Movie Rating Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the rating of Indian movies using features such as genre, director, actors, release year, and number of votes. The dataset is taken from Kaggle (IMDB India Movies dataset) and processed in Google Colab.

## Steps in the Project

1. **Data Loading** – Upload and read the dataset in Colab.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values and remove duplicates.
3. **Exploratory Analysis** – Create visualizations to understand trends.
4. **Feature Engineering** – Convert categorical features using One-Hot Encoding.
5. **Model Training** – Train a Linear Regression model to predict movie ratings.
6. **Evaluation** – Measure accuracy using MAE, RMSE, and R² score.
7. **Prediction** – Test the model by predicting the rating of a sample movie.

## Tools Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## Output

The model generates predicted ratings and provides insights into factors affecting movie performance.
